Have been very busy days since I arrived here, mostly on the founding of the travels inside the city takes pretty long time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is kind of interesting how much traffic there is here, but still the condition of the roads is really bad. Maybe that's how it is in development countrys, idk. I would most certainly never sit down in the drivers seat here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ate my first Kenyan meal ever today, we had lunch catered to teh office, I'm not very pleased. But I guess it tastes better in the mouths of them who eat meat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow it is time for Uganda. It's gonna be fun to stay in Kampala for two days before moving on to Mbarara. &lt;/p&gt;
